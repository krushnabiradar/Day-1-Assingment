Q1  .  Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?

Ans...

1) HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.1.
2) HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection.
3) HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing.
4) HTTP1.1 supports connection reuse.
5) HTTP1.1 is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication, NTLM authentication.
   while HTTP2 is better equipped to deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type Inadequate_Security.  

6) Main goals of developing HTTP/2 was:
	1) Page load speed improvements trough:
	2) Compression of request headers.
	3) HTTP/2 Server Push.
	4) HOL blocking (Head-of-line) — Package blocking.
	5) Request pipelining.

7) Benefits of HTTP2 over HTTP1.1(since it is the updated version of http1.1)
	1) less prone to errors.
	2) Lighter network footprints.
	3) Effective network resourse utilization.
	4) Low overhead in parsing data.

Q2  .  Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript??

Ans...

1) Object can be represented as
	Key value pair
	{
	 property:Value
	}
	 Function:

2) An object, is a reference data type
3) object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
4) The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.
5) We can access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
	objectName.propertyName
6) One of easiest way to create a javascript object is object literal,
   simply define the property and values inside curly braces as shown below
	
	let bike = {
		    name: 'ABC', 
		    Age:'XX',
		    DOB:'DD-MM-YYYY',
		    };
		
7) we can create JavaScript Object with Constructor as

	function detalis(firstname, lastname) {
   		type.firstname = firstname;
   		type.lastname = lastname;
		}

		let person1 = new details('Mohan', 'Singh’);
		let person2 = new details('John, 'Doe')
		console.log(person1.name);    //Output: Mohan
		console.log(person2.name);    //Output: John
